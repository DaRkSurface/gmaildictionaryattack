# gmaildictionaryattack - by DaRk
# This Script is only for educational purposes to show you how these attacks are done. 
# Do NOT use this in a malicious way to others without explicit concent!
## Keep In mind that you are violating **Gmails Terms Of Use** If you use this to "hack" accounts.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quick notes:
this is usable for most of OS's, Linux dist and Windows OS and Mac OS for example. Although if you're going to use windows use windows 10 only and use PowerShell as the terminal. 

This Attacker is not at all recommended now because of gmails rate limit on login attempts. Use this attacker only if you maybe have around 5 passwords which you know that one of them is correct. Otherwise you have to use cooldowns with I hopefully will code soon.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to open:
```python
cd PathWheregmaildictionaryattackIsLocated```
for example: 
```python
cd gmaildictionaryattack``` (If You already have done ```cd Desktop```

then do:
```python
ls```

This is optional this is only if you have changed the name of the .py or if you want to see all the files.

then do:
```python
cat README.md```

If you dont have python 3.x installed then install it!

This works only for Linux dist if you dont install it, but if you're on windows I don't think you need it:
```python
chmod +x gmailattack.py```

then do: 
```python
python3 gmailattack.py```

DONE!
